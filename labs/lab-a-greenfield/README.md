# Lab A – Greenfield: URL Shortener

**Goal**: Ship a tiny, production-shaped feature from nothing using SDD.

## Steps
1. Create a blank repo or use `starter/`.
2. Use the GitHub Spec Kit CLI to scaffold artifacts (e.g., principles, spec, clarifications, plan, tasks) from the templates in this lab.
3. Author `constitution/Project-Principles.md` (copy template, edit).
4. Create `Spec.md` from `templates/Spec.md` using the scenario below.
5. Create `Clarifications.md` and resolve questions.
6. Create `Plan.md` and `Tasks.md`.
7. Implement with your AI assistant; keep code aligned to the spec.
8. Ensure tests pass; open a PR for review.

## Definition of Done
- Principles committed; Spec/Clarifications/Plan/Tasks present.
- Minimal feature works end-to-end; tests green in CI.
