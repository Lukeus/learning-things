# Quick Reference – SDD with Spec Kit

**Flow**: Principles → Spec → Clarify → Plan → Tasks → Implement → Review

- **Principles**: A short “constitution” that sets non-negotiables (TDD, boundaries, performance budgets).
- **Spec**: Observable behavior (inputs/outputs/status codes), constraints, and 5–10 edge cases.
- **Clarify**: Targeted Q&A to remove ambiguity *before* planning.
- **Plan**: Modules, contracts, seams, risks, test strategy.
- **Tasks**: Small, testable, assignable work items.
- **Implement**: Let the assistant scaffold; keep to the plan; refactor behind clear seams.
- **Review**: Does the implementation match the spec? If not, update spec/plan and iterate.

> Use the GitHub Spec Kit CLI (`spec-kit …`) to generate and iterate on each artifact so learners practice the official workflow.
