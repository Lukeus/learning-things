# Assessment Rubric

**Scoring:** 0–2 points per criterion. **Pass threshold: ≥ 9/12 total points**

## 1. Clarity of Spec (0–2 points)
- **2 points:** Spec includes precise behavior, constraints (e.g., rate limits, formats), and ≥5 specific edge cases with expected outcomes.
- **1 point:** Spec covers behavior but lacks specificity in constraints or edge cases.
- **0 points:** Spec is vague, missing constraints, or has <3 edge cases.

## 2. Use of Clarification (0–2 points)
- **2 points:** Clarifications document asked material questions and resolved ambiguities before planning.
- **1 point:** Some clarification present but questions are superficial or not fully resolved.
- **0 points:** No clarification step, or plan created despite obvious ambiguities.

## 3. Plan Quality (0–2 points)
- **2 points:** Plan defines clear modules, ports/adapters, identifies risks with mitigations, and includes test strategy.
- **1 point:** Plan has some structure but lacks seams, risks, or test approach.
- **0 points:** No plan, or plan is just a list of files without architectural thinking.

## 4. Task Granularity (0–2 points)
- **2 points:** Tasks are small (≤1 hour each), testable, and tied to acceptance criteria.
- **1 point:** Tasks exist but are too large or not clearly testable.
- **0 points:** No task breakdown, or tasks are vague (e.g., "implement feature").

## 5. Implementation Fidelity (0–2 points)
- **2 points:** Code matches spec exactly; tests prove all acceptance criteria; edge cases handled.
- **1 point:** Code mostly matches spec but some edge cases or constraints missing.
- **0 points:** Implementation diverges significantly from spec; tests missing or failing.

## 6. Versioned Artifacts (0–2 points)
- **2 points:** All artifacts (Spec, Clarifications, Plan, Tasks, Principles) committed and up-to-date.
- **1 point:** Some artifacts committed but incomplete or out of sync with code.
- **0 points:** Artifacts not in version control or missing entirely.
