# Project Principles (Template)

1. **Behavior-First** – Specs describe black-box behavior; no stack assumptions.
2. **TDD Mandatory** – Tests precede implementation; Red→Green→Refactor.
3. **Boundaries** – Ports & Adapters; domain logic isolated; I/O behind interfaces.
4. **Security & Perf** – Rate limits, authN/Z, and perf budgets are specified up front.
5. **Artifacts** – Spec/Plan/Tasks are versioned and reviewed.
